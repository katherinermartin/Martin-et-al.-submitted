Please refer to [name].xlsx for full list and description of data files, analysis files, and R scripts. [name].xlsx can be organized by either MHC locus (more information below) or by analysis type.

The files listed in [name].xlsx are organized by locus in a few different ways:

- MHCI: just files pertaining to MHCI
  
- MHCII chr 14: just files pertaining to MHCII chr 14
  
- MHCII chr 1: just files pertaining to MHCII chr 1
  
- MHCII chr 14 and chr 1: files that contain data from both MHCII loci and are analyzed together
  
- MHCI, MHCII chr 14, MHCII chr 1: files that contain data from all three MHC loci from this study and analyzed together or used as input to the same script or analysis
  

#### This repository is organized in the following way:

- Scripts: located at katherinermartin/Martin-et-al.-submitted/scripts
  
- Data are in a few directories:
  
  - katherinermartin/Martin-et-al.-submitted/: data files here pertain to all three MHC loci
  
  - katherinermartin/Martin-et-al.-submitted/MHCI: MHCI-specific files
  
  - katherinermartin/Martin-et-al.-submitted/MHCII_chr1: MHCII chr1-specific files
  
  - katherinermartin/Martin-et-al.-submitted/MHCII_chr14: MHCII chr 14-specific files
  
  - katherinermartin/Martin-et-al.-submitted/MHCII_combined: files pertaining to both MHCII chr 14 and chr 1
